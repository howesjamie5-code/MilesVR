// The game's own button vocabulary, and the VR controls that answer it.
//
// Spidy's trouble with the game's prompts was never one prompt: VR play can
// send nine of the pad's controls and the game picks the one it asks for from
// all of them, so every story beat or encounter that wanted another one
// stopped a player ("Can't pull objects with LB + RB", "cant use Vents",
// "it says tap x repeat but tapping x opens the menu", Air Launch, the Fisk
// door, the Sable turrets). Each was patched on its own: the right stick's
// click for the game's LB + RB on October 11, that stick's pushes for its
// heal and its LT + RT on October 12.
//
// The game, though, names the button it wants, in a vocabulary it owns and
// that does not change with the moment: 203 icon ids (image offset 0x3a80300
// and up) with one icon map a device family in the UI's boot config
// (X360IconMap, XOneIconMap, DualShockIconMap, DualSenseIconMap,
// SteamDeckIconMap, SwitchProIconMap, GenericIconMap, MkbIconMap,
// SteamIconMap), and YUIIconMarkupConfig turning a text's markup into them.
// Every family's ids end in the same words - A, B, X, Y, DpadUp,
// StickRightPress, LeftShoulder, BothShoulders, BothTriggers - so one table
// over those endings answers for all nine families at once, and the letters
// the texts spell out ("LB + RB (Hold) Throw", the hint line of the Shocker
// fight) go in the same table. Nothing here is a list of the game's moments:
// a prompt says its button, this says what that asks of the pad and what the
// player does in VR instead.
